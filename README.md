Servicing
----
Some kind of site to manage servicing on a bunch of items around a bunch of sites, might be of use to people might not.   suggestions very welcome, code is fairly messy.

Installation
----
Requires PHP and MySQL, developed on windows but probably works elsewhere (I'll add a .htaccess and fix paths if needed)
 - composer install
 - bower install
 - copy config.php.example in the includes folder to config.php and edit appropriately.
 - Import database.sql into the database
